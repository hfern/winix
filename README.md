# Winix Controller

This is a Python library for controlling Winix C545 Air Purifier
devices. I reverse-engineered the API calls from the Android app. There
are a few weird idiosyncrasies with the Winix backends.

Included in this package is a CLI program `winixctl`.

## Setup

Install using PyPI: `pip install winix`.
You then have access to the `winix` module in python as well
as the `winixctl` command for shell (which uses the library).

## `winixctl` CLI

```
$ winixctl
usage: winixctl [-h] [--device DEVICE_SELECTOR] {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave} ...

Winix C545 Air Purifier Control

positional arguments:
  {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave}
    login               Authenticate Winix account
    refresh             Refresh account device metadata
    devices             List registered Winix devices
    getstate            Get device state
    fan                 Fan speed controls
    power               Power controls
    mode                Mode controls
    plasmawave          Plasmawave controls

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --device DEVICE_SELECTOR, -D DEVICE_SELECTOR
                        Device Index/Mac/Alias to use
```

In order to control your device, you first must run `winixctl login`.
this will save a token from the Winix backend in a file on your system
at `~/config/winix/config.json`. It will prompt you for a username
and password. You can use the `--username` and `--password` flags as well.


You can see the devives registered to your winix account
with `winixctl devices`.

    ~/dev/winix(master*) Â» winixctl devices
    1 devices:
    Device#0 (default) -------------------------------
          Device ID : 123456abcde_********** (hidden)
                Mac : 123456abcde
              Alias : Bedroom
           Location : SROU

    Missing a device? You might need to run refresh.

The last portion of the Device ID is hidden as it can be used to control
the device.

### Multi-device Support

By default the commands will work on the first device you have in your Winix account. If you
have multiple air purifiers, you can specify which device to use by specifying
a value for the top-level `--device` flag (short: `-D`).

You may specify one of:
- The device **index**. Example: `0` _(the default device selector)_.
- The device **mac**. Example: `123456abcde`. Mac values stay the same between device registration.
    If you have a device that you move between Wifi networks frequently then you will want
    to use this.
- The device **alias**. Example: `bedroom`. This is the most human-friendly version.


**Examples**

Turn off the bedroom air purifier _using an alias as the selector_:

    winixctl -D bedroom power off
