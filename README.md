# Winix Controller

This is a Python library for controlling Winix C545 Air Purifier
devices. I reverse-engineered the API calls from the Android app. There
are a few weird idiosyncrasies with the Winix backends.

Included in this package is a CLI program `winixctl`.

## Setup

Install using PyPI: `pip install winix`.
You then have access to the `winix` module in python as well
as the `winixctl` command for shell (which uses the library).

## `winixctl` CLI

```
$ winixctl
usage: winixctl [-h] {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave} ...

Winix C545 Air Purifier Control

positional arguments:
  {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave}
    login               Authenticate Winix account
    refresh             Refresh account device metadata
    devices             List registered Winix devices
    getstate            Get device state
    fan                 Fan speed controls
    power               Power controls
    mode                Mode controls
    plasmawave          Plasmawave controls

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

In order to control your device, you first must run `winixctl login`.
this will save a token from the Winix backend in a file on your system
at `~/config/winix/config.json`. It will prompt you for a username
and password. You can use the `--username` and `--password` flags as well.


You can see the devives registered to your winix account
with `winixctl devices`.

    ~/dev/winix(master*) Â» winixctl devices
    1 devices:
    Device#0 (default) -------------------------------
          Device ID : 123456abcde_********** (hidden)
                Mac : 123456abcde
              Alias : Bedroom
           Location : SROU

    Missing a device? You might need to run refresh.

The last portion of the Device ID is hidden as it can be used to control
the device.
